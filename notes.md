### Java

Differences between Java and C++
- built in garbage collection
- references instead of pointers
- data types are always the same size in java
- specific boolean data type and language constructs made to use it 
  - if(x = 1) is a compile error in Java
- classes dynamically linked at runtime (no separate link step)
- Java is a hybrid, compiled / interpreted language
- several other differences

print in java: 
System.out.println("Hello BYU!");
